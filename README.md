# John Cho's Portfolio

This is a collection of some exercises and programs I've worked on during my journey to learn Python.

The porfolio is divided into 2 parts: exercises and personal projects. 
* The exercises are a collection of ones that show some relevant skills such as working with Pandas.
* The projects are original programs I've put together.

Skills shown by exercises and projects:
* Pandas/Numpy
* Matplotlib/Seaborn
* Working with datetime
* Scraping with BeautifulSoup
* Parsing XML, JSON, HTML
* Sqlite w/ Python
* TFIDF vectorizer for keyword extraction
* Regex

The above examples should show that I have a basic understanding of how to use Python and some of the commonly used libraries.

Objects (creation and implementation) is ommitted from the above list as I do not have much experience with them yet.
