# John Cho's Portfolio

This is a collection of some exercises and programs I've worked on during my journey to learn Python.

The porfolio is divided into 2 parts: exercises and personal projects. 
* The exercises are a collection of ones that show some relevant skills such as working with Pandas.
* THe projects are original programs I've put together.
