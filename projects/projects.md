<h2> Projects/Description </h2>

<h3> Personal </h3>

* serious_eats_recipes_scrape / personal project to scrape and store recipes. Use NLP later on for information extraction to simplify recipes to be usable in a glance.

<h3> PlateIQ related </h3>

* keyword_analysis / simple analysis for correlation between term frequency and tfidf scores to determine if there's a "sweet spot" for good keywords. There isn't.
* priority_categories / use fuzz match between item names and category names and csim scores within categories to find categories worth cleaning. Needs work.
* tfid_cats / first attempt to find the "sweet spot" tfidf score to find good keyword that use to manually clean categories. 
* tfidf_cats_v2 / 2nd attempt to find "sweet spot" tfidf scores. Better preprocessing and tokenization. This is where I learned that there is no sweet spot.
